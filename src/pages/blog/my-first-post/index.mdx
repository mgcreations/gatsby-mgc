## Where I started

I have also been interested in writing programs, growing up my brother and I would write simple programs on the family's Commodore 64. He went on to study programming and I started working in the bank industry. But my interested remind in computers and programming. Years later, I studied an Introduction in Programming with Mircosoft C# part-time. Since then, I have been developing and designing websites.

## Has the website development platforms changed?

There was just a handful of development platforms, and each had their own requirement.

I started developing websites using Mircosoft’s .NET WebForms, it wasn’t very user friendly and took a long time to get simple websites up and running. Over the years they have improved their framework, which allows for faster web development and code separation. This makes it easier to update the website without rebuilding the entire website.
As the platforms changed over the years, so as the languages that is using on those platforms.

## What platforms do I use?

I mainly develop websites using the .NET Framework with C# as my language of choice. But not all site are created equal. Sometimes a plain static HTML site is the most effective, then that is what I will create.

Over the last couple of months, I have been looking and ReactJS. I have built a couple of small personal projects, just to learn the framework. Gatsby which is built on the React framework has been my main focus. I just like the way you can create a basic website with most of the bells and whistles in a matter of hours.

This site was developed on the Gatsby platform, even thou I broke my development environment, it still took me a couple of hours to have the basic site structure up and running.

## My coding languages

HTML and CSS is a must in designing and developing websites, so without says, I have a very good understanding of those two languages. SCSS is just the next level of CSS, which I have a basic understanding.

My coding language of choice is C# and my knowledge of the language is fairly extensive. I have writing a few sample code covering basic code blocks, which have been uploaded to Github. The nice thing with the .NET framework, both C# and Visual Basic can be complied in the same site. Being a developer, you can’t also choose what language a project is written that you have to maintain. I have taken over a site that was built using Visual Basic and I had to upgrade parts, which I did with C#.

Learning React and Gatsby, has given me the opportunity to learn JavaScript and Markdown.

Other languages of interest have been RUST and GO.

## Do I use Wordpress?

I don’t use Wordpress, I have looked at it as a CMS. I have had to maintain websites that were built using Wordpress, and most of the time, it is just jammed with plugins. Plugins are great and helpful, but the problems is that free plugins are used which only offers a small amount of usability and bloat the site. I most cases I would convert this site to a plain HTML site or develop a full stack solution using either React or .NET MVC.

## Final Words

I have written a lot of different code over the years, from basic HTML to developing on various systems. The past 13 plus years doing website development has been a constant learning experience. The joys of been able to code, is learning new things. And every time I code, I try to find a more efficient way of doing things. You have to write code to understand it, and the more you write, the better your coding skills develop. So here to a future of writing more code.
